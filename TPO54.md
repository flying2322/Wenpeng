Tea Drinking History

Listen to part of a lecture in a world history class.

Professor: Now, according to Chinese legend, the first person to drink tea was a Chinese emperor who lived nearly 5000 years ago.
This emperor was, oh, you could call him an amateur scientist.
And he wisely required all drinking water to be boiled for hygiene.
So, once, emm, when visiting some distant part of his empire, he noticed that a breeze had blown some leaves into his pot of boiling water and these leaves turned the water kind of brown.
So, well, would it be your first impulse to drink this?
Probably not. But he thought the resulting brews smell pretty good.
And in the name of science and discovery, he tasted it.
And the practice of drinking tea was born.

Oh, well, a good story.
But actually we cannot say with any certainty just who first discovered how to make tea.
We can be confident though, that the Chinese have been using it in some form for close to 5000 years.
And from those earliest times, more and more tea was cultivated to meet the growing demand, and tea became an important part of the economy of China.
In fact, it was formed into sort of bricks, and used as a common type of currency for trade.
But its effect on Chinese culture was even more profound.

Tea became extremely popular in China, and scholars even wrote works discussing how to grow tea, prepare it, drink it, really championing tea;
one of them saying it was like the sweetest dew of heaven.
Now, recommendations like this could only add to its huge popularity there.
But tea was also spreading throughout Asia.
In Japan, perhaps even more than in China, tea became a major cultural symbol, and one of refinement of etiquette and aesthetics.

Well, best seen in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, which is still performed today.
This is an intricate formal ritual, emm, ceremony that can take hours to complete.
Clearly, tea became not just a beverage in Japanese culture but much much more.
Tea eventually got to western Europe, after European traders, mainly Portuguese and Dutch, brought the first small commercial shipment of tea back to Europe.

Unfortunately, it was mostly just treated as a curiosity, since no one knew quite how it was supposed to be used.A few has some pretty strong opinions though.One German doctor wrote a book saying tea was harmful, actually poisonous.But at about the same time, another doctor from Holland wrote another book calling tea 'a miracle cure for just about everything'.Who to believe?

So, anyway, tea didn't really catch on in Germany or France, as something just to enjoy drinking, they seem to prefer coffee.
But England did take to tea.
And to an extent that nobody could have foreseen.
Such that, even today we tend to associate England, Great Britain with tea.
And, well, a bit of perspective, at the start of the 18th century, almost nobody in England drank tea.

But by the end of it, almost everybody did.

By the 1750s, official records show tea imports up from almost nothing to about 20 million kilos.

And those records didn't even begin to account for all the tea smuggled into the country illegally to avoid paying taxes.
And as for reasons for the popularity of tea there, well, tea first became fashionable after the king of England married a Portuguese princess who loved tea.
And pretty soon, more and more people started copying her and drinking tea.
Later, when a direct trade route was established between China and England, the supply of tea greatly increased.

Most important though, tea drinking became sociable.
And although coffee houses or tavern were generally considered to be for men only, tea shops became places where women could come.
And even bring their families.
And soon there were tea parties, books on tea etiquette, and even tea gardens-parks filled with lights and walkways and venues for musical performances,

places where people of all social classes could go to drink tea and socialize.
By the end of the 18th century, all classes of English society drank tea, from royalty to common workers.
Tea became a staple of everyday life, part of the common culture, and traditionally considered by many, the very mark of being English.

Long before cereal agriculture took hold far south of the Sahara, some hunter-gatherer groups in the savanna woodlands of eastern and southern Africa may have acquired cattle, and perhaps other domesticated animals, by gift exchange or through raids on herding neighbors.
在谷类农业占领最南部的撒哈拉沙漠之前，非洲东部和南部稀树草原地区的一些依靠狩猎和采集生活的人可能已经饲养了牛群和其他家养动物，他们将牲畜作为礼物交换，或者通过劫掠放牧的邻居，来获得这些牲畜。

Shifting agriculture, often called slash-and-burn, was highly adaptive for savanna farmers without plows, for it allowed cereal farming with the minimal expenditure of energy.

The selection of Manteno, Illinois, as a stop of the Illinois Central, for example, transformed the site from a crossroads without a single house in 1854 into a bustling town of nearly a thousand in 1860, replete with hotels, lumberyards, grain elevators, and gristmills.例如，伊利诺斯州中央铁路公司选择曼蒂诺（伊利诺斯州一处地名）建造了车站，使这个小村庄从1854年一个廖无人烟的岔道口转变为了1860年将近有一千人的繁华小镇，酒店、贮木场、谷物升降机、磨坊随处可见。

By the Civil War (1861–1865), few thought of the railroad-linked Midwest as a frontier region or viewed its inhabitants as pioneers.

西伯利亚：是乌拉山脉以东的广大地区的总称，占北亚的大部分，面积1276万平方公里，东至太平洋、北至北冰洋、南至中亚北部。现属俄罗斯，相当于该国领土总面积的75％。 西伯利亚气候严寒，一月平均气温为零下25 °C[1]，俄罗斯帝国和苏联时期被用作流放犯人的地方。西伯利亚此名称可能来自西伯利亚鞑靼语，意思就是“沉睡之地”（Sib Ir）。西伯利亚鞑靼人以此为国家名称建立西伯利亚汗国，后来被莫斯科大公国征服，西伯利亚此名词进入了俄语。也有说法为“鲜卑利亚”，来自鲜卑。亦有一个解释，西伯利亚被解作昔班的地方，因为他的封地位于西伯利亚。又有一说，沙俄以锡伯族的族名创造北亚的新地名。而在中国古地图上，西伯利亚被称为罗荒野。

1. Chinese population growth
- [ ]  Increases in population have usually been accompanied (indeed facilitated) by an increase in trade. 人口增长通常伴随着（事实上促进了）贸易的增加。
- [ ] There was also a gain in farm tools, draft animals, and fertilizer, to say nothing of the population growth itself, which increased half again as fast as cultivated land area and so increased the ratio of human hands available per unit of land. 农用工具、役畜和肥料方面都有进步，更不用说人口本身也有增长，增速是耕地面积增速的一半，因此增加了人均可用土地面积的比例。
- [ ] Corn, for instance, can be grown on the dry soil and marginal hill land of North China, where it is used for food, fuel, and fodder and provides something like one-seventh of the food energy available in the area. 拿玉米来说，可以在干燥的土壤和华北边缘的山地种植，可用作食品、燃料、饲料，提供了当地七分之一的食物能量。
2. Determining Dinosaur Diet恐龙到底吃啥
- [ ] equally sharp teeth farther back in their jaws.后部的牙齿要小一些但是同样锋利。
- [ ] These animals have flat teeth at the back of the jaw that are analogous to and have the same function as grindstones. 它们后部的牙齿比较扁平，功能类似于研磨的石头。

- [ ] The jaw joints of many advanced herbivores, such as cows, lie at a different level than the tooth row, allowing transverse tearing, shredding, and compression of plant material.许多高等草食动物，如牛，颌关节和牙齿的高度并不一致，这样它们就能横向撕裂、切碎和挤压植物。

- [ ] Further research indicated that the small dinosaurs were too large and too well developed to be prehatchling young.进一步的研究发现，这些幼崽体积太大，而且发育良好，不可能是孵化前的幼崽。
- [ ] All the evidence points to the conclusion that these are the remains of prey items and that, as an adult, Coelophysis was at least in part a cannibal.所有的证据都表明，这些都是猎物的残骸，成年腔骨龙中至少有一部分是吃自己的同类的

- [ ] Similar finds in Corythosaurus specimens from Alberta, Canada, have also been reported, indicating that at least two kinds of Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs fed on the sorts of trees that are common in today’s boreal woodlands.
- [ ] 加拿大阿尔伯塔的冠龙标本也报导了类似的发现，这表明至少有两种晚白垩纪的鸭嘴龙是以现在北半球森林中的常见树木为食的。


2. Climate and urban development
- [ ] retard.  vt. 使减速;妨碍;阻止
- [ ] outpouring 倾泻 流出 流露
- [ ] 诚实热岛源于工业和城市发展，在乡村，太阳能大部分被用来蒸发植被和土壤的水分。在城市，植被和暴漏的土壤较少，大部分的太阳能被城市建组结构和沥青道路所吸收。因此，白天暖和的时候，城市较少的蒸发降温使提升城市区域的表面温度成为可能。
- [ ] retarded adj. (尤指儿童)(智力)发育迟缓的, 弱智的
- [ ]  This piling up of air over the city then slowly rises, much like toothpaste does when its tube is squeezed. 城市上空堆积的空气慢慢地上升，就像挤牙膏一样。
- [ ] Such an event is especially probable if vertical mixing and dispersion of pollutants are inhibited. Pollutants from urban areas may even affect the weather downwind from them.如果污染物在垂直方向上不能混合或者扩散的话，就更容易聚集了。从城市地区吹来的污染物甚至可以影响到它们的顺风方向的天气。
